<h1 align="center">ÁÅØ - Akari</h1>

Akari is a Next.js application designed to provide an enhanced manga reading experience for [Manganato](https://manganato.com/) users. It uses manganato as a backend, leveraging its content while allowing users to manage and retain their bookmarks from the site directly within the application.

# Features

- **Seamless Manga Reading Experience:** Enjoy reading your favorite manga with a smooth interface.
- **Bookmark Integration:** All your bookmarks are synced and saved, allowing you to pick up where you left off, using the Manganato bookmark system.
- **All Manganato Features:** All normal manganato features are available.
- **Remove Bookmarks on Manga Page:** Instead of having to find the manga in the bookmarks page, simply remove it from it's main page.
- **Search Through Bookmarks:** Search through all your bookmarks to find the manga you are looking for.

# Settings

- **Fetch MAL Image:** Uses the public `jikan` api to try and find the manga on `MyAnimeList` to get a better cover for it. Can be wrong, specially for smaller titles.

# Getting Started
